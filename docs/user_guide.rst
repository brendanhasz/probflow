For a quick start, take a look at the :ref:`examples`.

The user guide contains more detailed information about using ProbFlow, including:

- A brief description of :ref:`Bayesian modeling <ug_inference>`,
- Creating Bayesian models using :ref:`ug_distributions`, :ref:`ug_parameters`, :ref:`ug_modules`, and :ref:`Models <ug_models>`,
- How to :ref:`fit those models <ug_fitting>` to data,
- How to :ref:`make predictions <ug_predicting>` with those models,
- How to :ref:`evaluate <ug_evaluating>` the performance of a model,
- How to :ref:`inspect <ug_inspecting>` a model's structure and the values of its parameters,
- How to use ProbFlow's :ref:`ug_applications`, and
- :ref:`ug_math` about how ProbFlow fits Bayesian models.
